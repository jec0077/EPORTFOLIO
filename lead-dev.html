										<h2>Youth Leading Youth</h2>
									</header>
									<p>My leadership journey began at Apostolic Faith Church. At age 12, I was named <strong>Youth Co-Coordinator of the Youth Assistance Ministry</strong>. This leadership role required me to organize and plan Sunday morning youth services with youth ministers and church leaders. I was also responsible for managing audio and video technologies being used in services like PowerPoint presentations, video projectors, and audio engineering, to name a few. My team created a more efficient system preparing church leaders to teach children using technology to add a fun and engaging twist.<center><iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rgI4LYWPE3Q??autoplay=1&mute=1controls=0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe></center></p>
